Changes in project plan

The project has slightly changed since its initial plan. 
Key enhancements include the introduction of a scoring system 
with a winning condition of 10 points that rewards players for eliminating opponents. 
Players cannot pick up powerups or items, as these were optional tasks that could have been implemented. 
The class design has also become more detailed, with specific methods and interactions outlined for traps and projectiles. 
The tile map is now random such that we found it easier to code and would appear more creative to players 
such that every map looks different but with familiar mechanics. 
The use of nodes was not used in the project such that we felt this feature was not as important to be spending our time with 
rather than more important features such as the implementation of polymorphism.
